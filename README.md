# InfoCo-beamer-template

HiðŸ‘‹ Here are some beamer templates which are secondary creations of [SINTEF Presentation](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sintef-presentation/jhbhdffczpnx) template and [college-beamer](https://github.com/liu-qilong/college-beamer). Thanks [Federico Zenith](federico.zenith@sintef.no) for creating such well-designed works. To use it in my and my friends' schools/institutes, I rewrote and added some icons and features to adapt to specific surroundingsâœ¨.

This is the template modified and used for XJTLU InfoCo.

For the full contribution lists, please go to [college-beamer](https://github.com/liu-qilong/college-beamer).

> Noted that if you'd like to include Chinese text, please use XeLaTeX for typesetting.

## Usage

```
\usepackage[en]{infocoBeamer}

> When select `zh`, please add the `xeCJK`package to the preamble and use XeLaTeX as the typesetting engine.

```
